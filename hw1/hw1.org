* Shared or forgotten keys?
1) Which two basic security properties should be considered in the design of a secure protocol for solving the above problem and why do these properties become relevant in this setting?
 - Confidentiality
   - Since they are communicating over an insecure protocol, they should ensure that the messages that they exchange are encrypted or obfuscated so that other malicious parties with access to the channel cannot determine their interactions
 - Integrity
   - Since Alice and Bob will depend on their secret key for their future interactions, they need to be certain that their interactions are a valid confirmation of their shared secret key. Hence, if an attacker can compromise the integrity of their interactions, they may assume 

* Crypt-analyze this!
